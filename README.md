# Decidim::Members

Members list and search plugin for Decidim (v0.9 onwards).

## Usage

Adding this plugin to your Decidim based Rails app will add a new main menu
entry _Members_ which shows a searchable list of all members.

For now, the plugin depends on a small core patch which is located in the
`extra` directory.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'decidim-members', git: "https://github.com/basicavisual/decidim-members"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install decidim-members
```
